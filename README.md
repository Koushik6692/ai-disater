# Abstract

Natural disaster prediction is a critical field aimed at forecasting the occurrence, intensity, and impact of natural hazards such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, wildfires, tsunamis, and more. Predicting these events accurately and with sufficient lead time is crucial for minimizing loss of life and property damage, as well as for effective disaster preparedness and response planning. In conclusion, natural disaster prediction is a dynamic and evolving field that plays a crucial role in disaster risk reduction and management. Advances in technology, coupled with interdisciplinary collaboration and improved data accessibility, hold promise for enhancing our ability to predict and mitigate the impact of natural hazards globally.
